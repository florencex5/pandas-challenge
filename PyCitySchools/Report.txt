#Summarizes the analysis

There are total 15 schools / 39710 students selected in this dataset. The average scores for both reading and 
math are close around with 80. The percentage of passing reading (81.88%) is higher than the percentage of 
passing math (74.98%). However, the overall passing rate (passed both math and reading) is only 65.17%.
According to the school summary, this overall passing rate is composed by two extreme top and low ranges. 
If we sort the values per overall passing rate, more than half of schools (8 in total) has above or around
90% overall passing rate. And for the rest of 7 schools, their passing rate are as low as between 52%-55%.
The top three performing schools are Cabrera(91.33% overall passing), Thomas(90.95% overall passing) and
Griffin(90.60% overall passing). The bottom performing schools are Rodriguez(52.99% overall passing),
Figueroa (53.20% overall passing) and Huang(53.51% overall passing).


#Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations

1) Based on the summary of scores by school types, all schools in this dataset are distributed between Charter 
and District. Charter’s overall passing rate takes the particularly leading role with 90.43%. Its percentage 
passing rate for both math and reading are close with each other. While District only has 53.67% overall passing 
rate, and its poor performance on math (66.55% passing rate) is the main factor to pull down its overall rate.

Referring back to the summary of math score by grade and the school summary, the math score pass level
is set up as 70.The average math score for each grade from District (75 - 78) is slightly above the criteria.But
the average math score for each grade from Charter is all above 82.In addition, for each school, their average
maths scores from different grades have similar performances. Therefore,there is no significant correlation between
the grades and average math scores.


2) Comparing the summary of top school and bottom schools,

    i) The bottom performing schools have larger school size than the highest-performing schools.

            The summary of scores by school size demonstrate a general opinion that larger school size has a 
            weaker academic performance, especially in math. Large school size has 69.96% passing rate for math, 
            whereas 93.55% students from small school size passed math subject. For those students studied in 
            medium school size have the best academic performances with 90.62% overall passing rate, which is 
            lightly higher than 89.88% overall passing rate in small school size. 
        
            The top schools summary also proves that the first three highest-performing schools all fall into 
            “Medium” school size (1000-2000 students).On the other side, the bottom schools summary shows their 
            school size all belong to “Large” school size (2000-5000 students).

    ii) The highest-performing schools have lower per student budget than the bottom performing schools. 

            According to the school summary, it shows that Wilson High School (90.58% overall passing) has the 
            lowest budget per student ($578). But it is also one of the top five performing school, while per 
            student budget for all the bottom performing schools reach above $600. For instance, Rodriguez high 
            school performed at the worst level with only 52.99% overall passing rate. And its per student budget 
            is as high as $637.
            
            Double checking the summary of scores by school spending, the result shows a clear negative 
            correlation between the spending ranges and overall passing rate as well. Furthermore, with a
            decreasing overall passing rate, the difference between % passing math and % passing reading increases
            instead.
